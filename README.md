# Information if you want to use all the icons intended for this Navbar
* You need to install a patch which is

## then import from the following link
* import { FaBars, FaTimes } from "react-icons/fa";



- if you want to check more icons, go to =>

**********************************************************************************


# If you want to use the share button code. 

* And you want to change the link where it should go, and if you want to change icons,
need to make changes in three places, 

* 1. App.tsx => here you change link to icon

* 2. buttens.scss => from line 118 downwards, you change the name of the link as well as the color name,
 
* 3. _colors.scss => here you change the color code for the icon and what it should be called.

* I recommend that you check this link =>
