# Planning Management Web App

This program is an experiment developed as part of my studies. Its purpose is to create a local website application for managing planning and providing easy access to service protocols for mechanics. The aim is to eliminate the need for working with convoluted Excel files. Additionally, the application is designed to be accessible via mobile phones and allows for direct emailing of documents to supervisors.

## Features

- **Planning Management:** Organize and manage planning schedules efficiently.
- **Service Protocol Access:** Easily access service protocols without the hassle of Excel files.
- **Mobile Compatibility:** Designed to be accessible and functional on mobile devices.
- **Direct Emailing:** Send documents directly to supervisors via email.

## Future Development

While this project is still in progress, I may not be able to complete it entirely on my own. If you're interested in contributing or providing assistance, feel free to do so!
